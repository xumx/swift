Patients can enjoy subsidy rates of up to 87.5% for these medications. The list of medications can be found at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://go.gov.sg/healthiersg-medication-list\">https://go.gov.sg/healthiersg-medication-list</a>.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Patients will also enjoy additional subsidies on their consultation fees at GP clinics, subject to annual and per visit dollar limits. Patient need not pay for consultation fees in situations where the subsidy limits are higher than the consultation charges. For instance, a CHAS Green patient with one chronic condition has a per visit limit of $28. If the GP charges $25 for the consultation, a full subsidy of $25 will be provided. If the GP charges $35 for the consultation, a subsidy of $28 is provided and the patient will pay the remaining $7. On the other hand, there is no overall annual dollar limit at polyclinics but patient would need to make some small payment for every consultation visit which are already subsidised. &nbsp;</p><p><s>&nbsp;</s></p><p>If you are not a CHAS/MG/PG cardholder, the prevailing GP clinic rates apply.
