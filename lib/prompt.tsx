- When can I enrol in Healthier SG? Is it compulsory for Singaporeans to join Healthier SG?
	- The Healthier SG (HSG) national enrolment programme will be rolled out in phases from 5 July
	  2023 onwards. Enrolment is not mandatory however, we strongly encourage you to enrol with  
	  a HSG clinic so that the family doctor can serve as the first point-of-contact to guide you in  
	  managing your health holistically.  
- How will I know if I am eligible for Healthier SG?
	- Healthier SG targets Singapore citizens (SC) and permanent residents (PR) who are aged 40
	  years old and above. For a start, MOH will invite Singapore residents starting with those aged  
	  60 years and above regular chronic patients to enrol with a family clinic, followed by regular  
	  chronic patients in the 40 to 59 age group and thereafter the remaining 40 years and above in the  
	  next two years. The rollout phases will prioritise those who are more likely to fall sick or suffer  
	  from chronic illnesses. MOH will be sending SMS invites to those who are eligible. Do keep a  
	  lookout for updates on the latest eligibility criteria on the Healthier SG website.  
- Are there plans for those aged below 40 years old to be included in Healthier SG?
	- The Ministry will explore this in future after we enrol residents aged 40 and above.
	- The older age group tend to have more co-morbidities and are the most vulnerable to chronic
	  illnesses hence Healthier SG will target the older age group first and those with chronic  
	  illnesses to proactively prevent them from falling ill.  
	- In the meantime, all residents should continue to stay active and live healthily. There are a
	  variety of community programmes available, including : People's Association (PA) activities,  
	  SportSG ActiveHealth programmes, and Health Promotion Board's (HPB) National Steps  
	  Challenge and Eat, Drink, Shop Healthy Challenge!
- If I have not received the SMS invitation to join Healthier SG, what do I do?
	- MOH has invited Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents aged 40 and above via SMS to enrol with a Healthier SG clinic or polyclinic. SMS invitations will continue to be sent to residents when they turn 40 years old. If you are 40 and above, you can self-enrol using the HealthHub app or enrol at any of the Enrolment Stations (see https://gowhere.gov.sg/healthiersg for locations) without the need of an SMS invitation.
	- Residents who need any clarification can call MOH Hotline 6325 9220.`;
